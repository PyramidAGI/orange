## Tree climbing robot simulator — options

Four options for a CLI-based simulator, using the ideas from this directory.

---

### Option A: Log-driven state machine

The robot's state (position on trunk, grip, energy) is a set of log.csv rows written each tick. The CLI reads the tail of the log to display current state. Every action appends a new record. Fully faithful to the existing format — the simulator *is* the log.

### Option B: Quark-state simulator

The robot's state is a dict of active quarks with numeric values — `loc=40`, `force=60`, `energy=80`, etc. CLI commands (e.g. `grip`, `climb`, `rest`) map to quarks via combinations.csv, which then update the state values. Closest to the quark vocabulary already built.

### Option C: Double-triangle control loop

Implement the sensor/actuator/control/plan/nav skeleton from the green readme. The robot has live sensor readings (`force`, `loc`, `energy`) and actuators (`drive`, `animate`). The CLI runs the loop step by step and prints each phase. This is the most architecturally correct version — a robot running a double triangle.

### Option D: Natural language → quark → action

User types free text (`"tighten grip on trunk"`), it gets mapped to quarks via `quark_overlap.py`, and the matched quarks drive the simulation step. Slowest (API call per command) but the most integrated with the existing toolchain.

---

The most coherent with the existing system would be **B + A together**: quark-state values as the simulation engine, log.csv as the output record. Option C is the right architecture if you want to eventually run this on a real robot. Option D is the most experimental.
